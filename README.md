# Exdata013 Course Project 1

 Purpose: generate exploratory graphs from UCI Machine Learning Repository's electric power consumption data
 
## Codes and graphs
 
 Four plots were generated, named Plot1 through Plot4. The R codes are named accordingly. 
 
 All plots utilize data accessed on February 6th, 2015. The codes input is a file of data, specifically "household_power_consumption.txt", and output is a PNG file.
 
### Plot 1

The first graph generated is a histogram of global active power (in kilowatts) during Thursday, February 1st, 2007, and Friday, February 2nd, 2007.

### Plot 2

Plot 2 global active power rate during Thursday, February 1st, 2007, to Friday, February 2nd, 2007.

### Plot 3

Plot 3 looks at the energy sub metering from Thursday, February 1st, 2007, and Friday, February 2nd, 2007.

### Plot 4

Plot 4 has four sections, showing Global Active Power, Voltage, Energy sub metering, and Global Reactive Power, all versus date/time.
